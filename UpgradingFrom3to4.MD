# 1. Upgrading from Syscoin 3.x to Syscoin 4.x

_If you have already upgraded to Syscoin 4.0.0 successfully, you only need to install the latest version of [Syscoin 4.x](https://github.com/syscoin/syscoin/releases) and skip these steps._



### This upgrade procedure has TWO parts:

**1.** You will DUMP your existing Syscoin 3.x wallet keys from Blockmarket or Syscoin QT 3.x into a text file in your public folder.   
  
**2.** You will then need to IMPORT the newly created file into a Syscoin 4.x wallet. 
>
> **WARNING:** Do NOT copy your wallet.dat into the new 'Syscoin' folder. Syscoin 3 and Syscoin 4 wallet.dat files are incompatible.
>  
>


### GET A CLEAN START:
   
Rename any DATA FOLDER called `Syscoin`. If you have a DATA FOLDER called `Syscoin` from a previous installation of **Syscoin 2.x**, you will need to rename it `Syscoin2` or you will encounter errors attempting to read incompatible data.  **Syscoin 4.x** creates and writes to a DATA FOLDER called `Syscoin`. 

Now you will need to open either Blockmarket or Syscoin Qt 3.x and unlock the wallet. You do NOT need to synchronise to the Syscoin 3 chain.   
  
<details>
<summary>Find your DATA FOLDER</summary>

>
The DATA FOLDER is found here:
> * MAC: `/Users/[USERNAME]/Library/Application Support/Syscoin`  
> Note: the Library directory is hidden by default, you can quickly access this directory by pressing: CMD + Shift + G in Finder then typing:  `~/Library/Application Support/Syscoin`
>
> * WINDOWS: `C:\Users[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\Syscoin`
>
> * LINUX: `/home/[USERNAME]/.Syscoin` or `~/.syscoin/` 
>  You may need to do a "ls -a" to see directories that start with a dot.
>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Getting your system ready</summary>

>
If you have already installed Syscoin Qt 4, Spark 4 or Fusion 4, you can skip these steps.
> * Rename any existing `Syscoin` DATA FOLDER from Syscoin 2.x to `Syscoin2`.
> * If you do not have a `Syscoin` DATA FOLDER, Syscoin 4 will create one for you when run.
> * Syscoin 3 uses a DATA FOLDER called `SyscoinCore` which should be one level higher in your folders list - _leave this folder alone_ or you will not be able to run your current Syscoin 3.x wallet!


</details>

<details>
<summary>Unlocking your wallet</summary>

> * In Syscoin Qt 3.x go to Console: Tools->Debug Console and type:  
> `walletpassphrase “mypasswordorpassphrase” 180`  
> And press ENTER (180 = this the amount of time to remain open in seconds)
>
> * In Blockmarket: Click the Lock icon in the upper right menu.  
> Enter your password/passphrase in the form field and press the Unlock button
>
